# ProjectOne
Project One submission for CS-210
The project was to create a 12 and 24 hour clock that the end user could interface with. Two clocks were created that functioned separately and were able to be manipulated separately without effecting the other as well. I fulfilled the task using clean reusable code, with a short amount of code used to create it. To enhance the code I could make it a live time clock by location and add more of a user friendly interface. The most challenging part of writing the code was creating a user interface that functioned with the code cleanly and efficiently. Being able to create something a user can interface is a good skill to have. I made the code readable and adaptable by allowing for variables to be changed, allowing for things to be added, and making it clean and simple.
